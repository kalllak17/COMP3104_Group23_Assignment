Importance of learning DevOps in the software development cycle.

In today's fast-paced and constantly evolving software development environment, acquiring advanced CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) skills is essential. As customer requirements frequently change, DevOps practices help teams adapt quickly by reducing human error, increasing deployment speed, and improving overall reliability.

However, while DevOps offers many benefits, it also comes with some challenges. These include the complexity of setting up CI/CD pipelines, the steep learning curve for new tools, and the need for strong collaboration across teams, which can be difficult to establish in traditional organizations.
